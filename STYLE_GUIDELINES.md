Style guidlines: PascalCase for types, member names, function names, property names, field names, class/struct names. camelCase for local variable names, and function argument names. No _ allowed. No comments anywhere. For anything that supports it like Lists, use [] rather than new(). Generally use new() rather than like new Vector4(). Do not use var. Do not use new() in function arguments, only in places where the intended type is obvious, e.g. Vector4 vector = new(...). nameof() is disallowed, use actual error messages.
